<h2 align="center">Hello there! I hope you are well.</h2>

Here are some of my personal projects, they might be interesting for you to see!

A little bit about me:

- I am a Business Administration student at University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).

- I really like learning about business, statics, data science, software development, or similar topics. If I'm  not coding or searching for some of these themes, you will probably find me looking for a new book to read or a new music album to listen.

Most of the time I'm coding with Python, SQL or VBA. However, I've also had some experiences with Arduino and C++ in the past.
